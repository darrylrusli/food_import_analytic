# food_import_analytic

Background: Australia is multicultural country where people from different country migrate to Australia to seek better quality of life which allows overseas food import. However, Australian government enforced strict biosecurity procedure to prevent harmful diseases. This is official data published by Australian Government was used to identify high risk food that was imported in Australia but fail most of the time during the food inspection at the International Border.
−	Data exploration to come with business questions
−	Data visualisation using Tableau
−	Analysed data for trends and patterns and to find answers to questions
−	Recommended solutions based on insights


Findings: Generated the findiing using Tableau where I have identified 2 food suppliers which Malabar Foods and Global Gourmet often fail to comply with the Australian Food Regulation which I believe it will help the government to make the decision in reducing the food import that fails during the food inspection and make the food suppliers comply better in Australian Food Regulation.
